# Known bugs (after v1.0.0)

Bugs we have seen and chose to ship with in 1.0. Each entry: what a player sees, the evidence, where to start, and the
test that shows it. Fixing one: a test in the fastest tier that can show it first (CLAUDE.md), then the fix, then
delete the entry and say where the evidence went. Unfinished work and unexplained behaviour stay in
`docs/progress.md` ("Loose ends"); ideas in `docs/ideas.md`. The fixes and regression evidence for feature 14's
visible actor bugs are in [small-bugs.md](design/small-bugs.md). Native bug fixes and regression evidence are in
[native-bugs.md](design/native-bugs.md).

## Party travel

Party travel was accepted for v1.0.0 testing by the user on 2026-10-27. Jail cleanup, horse packages, physics
carry/loss checks and the release-time physics lock ordering now have fixes and evidence in
[native-bugs.md](design/native-bugs.md). The separate AI/quest pair below remains deferred by the user (2026-10-28).

- **An AI/quest lock inversion was reported during travel** (2026-10-27, party-travel). The departure timing
  assertions pass, but `party-loads-overlap` fails the scenario's final lock audit. The reported path is native
  low-actor AI/package evaluation -> `TESQuest::sub_25066`, through the existing `HookUpdateAI`; the opposite
  pair is quest alias processing. No deadlock occurred in that run. Evidence:
  `.worktrees/party-travel/build/final-native-lock.log` and `build/regression-final-native.log`.
  - Start: reproduce the pair on unchanged dev and inspect quest/AI lock ordering; that baseline comparison
    has not been performed. This is not evidence that the new destination announcement itself holds these locks.

## Plugin compatibility

- **Quest start/stop notification parity is deferred with mod work.** Vanilla guest journal, stage and completion
  synchronization works, but a plugin consuming only TESQuestStartStopEvent can miss a stop. The audit removed
  the additional relay after it produced host stop 1 / guest stop 2 on a native turn-in
  (`build/check/evidence-audit/native-gameplay.log`). Experience and Skill Uncapper are outside v1.0.0 scope.
  - Start: investigate actual native notification sources with the intended consumer installed. Do not synthesize
    another stop from flag changes or add a timing-based duplicate filter. Native counters remain available through
    `quest_fragments`; journal/reward tests keep their vanilla stage and completion assertions.

## Physics and ragdolls

The user accepted these three remaining reports for v1.0.0 on 2026-10-28. Further fixes are deferred.
The audit removed unsuccessful pose reconstruction; existing native checks and failed traces remain.
Retained changes and their evidence are in [native-bugs.md](design/native-bugs.md).

- **Brief get-up timing or facing differences.** Basic owner timing, get-up preparation/action and iGetUpType
  synchronization remain. All six regular physics/death/revival scenarios pass once in the reduced build
  (`build/check/evidence-audit/native-physics.log`); this does not establish that the historical intermittent
  timing/facing differences are gone.
  - Start: compare native owner/copy action timing and get-up choice in `knockdown-front-and-back`. Earlier failed
    experiments and traces are retained; implementation-only cache tests did not establish native fidelity.
- **Dead guest's copy can have a displaced pose.** The original report was a 16-unit body offset with three bones
  displaced up to 17 units. The reduced build passes one complete guest death/revive and one kill-move scenario
  (`build/check/evidence-audit/native-physics.log`). Retained as accepted; consecutive verification is incomplete.
  - Start: repeat `death-spectate-guest` and compare the owner/copy `RagdollTrace` if alignment fails.
- **Occasional ragdoll bone jitter or get-up snap.** The reduced build passes regular lying, knockdown smoke and
  kill-move checks. The added front/back check still catches jitter, with about 11 units of visible owner/copy
  bone difference (`build/check/evidence-audit/native-gameplay.log`). The final smoke also catches a 13-unit
  skeleton snap for one frame at knock state 5->6 (`build/check/evidence-audit/shadow-native.log`).
  - Start: inspect the native knock-state 5/6 handoff and per-bone trace. Compare visible owner/copy poses as well
    as body alignment; the owner's own get-up bones can also leave its physics bodies.
