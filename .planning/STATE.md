## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: GATE-01/GATE-02 placed in Phase 1 as go/no-go gates before full migration investment
- Roadmap: Phases 4-5 (debug, testing) can parallelize with Phase 3 since they depend on Phase 2 only
- Roadmap: UI port (Phase 6) deferred to last since it requires client DLL structure from Phase 3
- [Phase 01]: XMake v3.0.8 installed, MinGW platform block uses static linking to prevent runtime DLL deps
- [Phase 01]: GATE-01 uses inline C-compatible SKSE structs, GATE-02 hooks GetTickCount for initial validation
- [Phase 01]: XMake v3 requires add_requires() in root scope; MinGW needs set_prefixname('') for SKSE-compatible DLL names
- [Phase 02]: rpmalloc replaces mimalloc as default allocator (MinGW/GCC compatible)
- [Phase 02]: All MSVC build blocks deleted from root xmake.lua (clean break per D-02)
- [Phase 02]: sentry-native removed with HAS_SENTRY conditionals for future re-enablement
- [Phase 02]: ThreadUtils uses platform-native APIs: SetThreadDescription (Win10+) and pthread_setname_np (Linux)
- [Phase 02]: Tier 3 client targets gated behind is_plat windows|mingw in libraries/xmake.lua

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 GATE-01/GATE-02 are binary go/no-go. If MinGW cannot produce valid SKSE plugins, the entire MinGW approach needs rethinking.
- Phase 3 is HIGH risk per research: MinHook/Xbyak cross-compilation, SKSE ABI compatibility, CEF exclusion strategy.
- Phase 4 MEDIUM risk: Wine upgrade may break existing Proton setup.
